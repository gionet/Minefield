# Minefield Solver  
  
## Requirement:  
  
There is a minefield of size n x m where random fields having a bomb. The safe path always exists. There is a dog named 
Totoshka which can smell if any adjacent field has a bomb. Create an algorithm with would allow Totoshka to pass 
through the minefield.[^1]  
  
There is a girl Ally who is following Totoshka. Ally always stand on the field where Totoshka was before. Totoshka and 
Ally cannot stand on the same field. Create and algorithm for Totoshka and Ally to pass through the minefield.[^2]  
  
Write down the C# implementation of the previous task.[^3]
